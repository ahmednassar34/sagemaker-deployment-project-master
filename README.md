# SageMaker Deployment Project

## About
The notebook and Python files provided here, once completed, result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews. This project assumes some familiarity with SageMaker, the mini-project, Sentiment Analysis using XGBoost, should provide enough background.

## Project
[Sentiment Analysis Web App](https://github.com/ahmednassar34/sagemaker-deployment-project-master.git) is a notebook and collection of Python files to be completed. The result is a deployed RNN performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews complete with publicly accessible API and a simple web page which interacts with the deployed endpoint. This project assumes that you have some familiarity with SageMaker. Completing the XGBoost Sentiment Analysis notebook should suffice.

## Udacity repository
Please see the [README](https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment/tree/master/README.md) in the root directory for instructions on setting up a SageMaker notebook and downloading the project files (as well as the other notebooks).
